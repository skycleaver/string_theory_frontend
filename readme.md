# String Theory

String Theory aims to be an open-source tool that helps amateur musicians perform and compose pieces of music.


Its goal is to automate time consuming and/or boring tasks like figuring out the chords of a scale or all the possible
fingerings of an A minor to make playing and making music as enjoyable and creative as possible.
